    <h1>Real-time Ransomware Infection Detection System based on Social Big Data Mining</h1>
    <h2>Keyword: Ransomware, Data Mining</h2>
    <p>
        Ransomware, a malicious software that requires a ransom by encrypting a file, is becoming more
        threatening with its rapid propagation and intelligence. Rapid detection and risk analysis are required,
        but real-time analysis and reporting are lacking. In this paper, we propose a ransomware infection detection
        system using social big data mining technology to enable real-time analysis. The system analyzes the twitter
        stream in real time and crawls tweets with keywords related to ransomware. It also extracts keywords related
        to ransomware by crawling the news server through the news feed parser and extracts news or statistical data
        on the servers of the security company or search engine. The collected data is analyzed by data mining
        algorithms. By comparing the number of related tweets, google trends (statistical information), and articles
        related wannacry and locky ransomware infection spreading in 2017, we show that our system has the possibility
        of ransomware infection detection using tweets. Moreover, the performance of proposed system is shown through
        entropy and chi-square analysis.

    <h1>Private Blockchain and Smart Contract Based High Trustiness Crowdsensing Incentive Mechanism</h1>
    <h2>Keyword: Crowdsensing, Blockchain, Smart Contract, Trustiness, Incentive Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
        To implement crowdsensing system in reality, trustiness between service provider server and user is necessary.
        Service provider server could manipulate the evaluation of sensing data to reduce incentive. Moreover, user
        could send a fake sensing data to get unjust incentive. In this paper, we adopt private blockchain on
        crowdsensing system, and thus paid incentives and sent data are unmodifiablely recorded. It makes server and
        users act as watcher of each others. Through adopting smart contract, our system automates sensing data
        evaluation and opens to users how it works. Finally, we show the feasibility of proposing system with
        performance evaluation and comparison with other systems.

    <h1>Building Crowdsensing Based Saturation Prediction Model for Smart Parking System</h1>
    <h2>Keyword: Crowdsensing, Samrt Parking System, Regression Model</h2>
    <p>
        Crowdsensing based smart parking system is more efficient than present sensor based smart parking system
        because of low install price and no restriction caused by sensor installation. A lot of sensing data is
        necessary to predict parking lot saturation in realtime. But in real world, it is hard to reach the required
        number of sensing data. In this paper, we build a time-based prediction model and a sensing data-based
        prediction model to predict parking lot saturation in high accuracy. Time-based prediction model predicts
        saturation aspect based on parking lot location and time. Sensing data-based prediction model predicts
        saturation of parking lots based on partial saturation included in sensing data. We show efficiency and
        feasibility of the system by evaluating performance of prediction model.
